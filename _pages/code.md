This page contains code necessary for the reproduction of computations executed as part my paper 'Greedy base sizes for sporadic simple groups'. In particular [click here to download my implementation of the greedy algorithm in MAGMA](https://github.com/coendelvalle/coendelvalle.github.io/raw/main/files/greedy.txt), and [click here to download my GAP implementation of the functions Qhat and D](https://github.com/coendelvalle/coendelvalle.github.io/raw/main/files/QD.txt)
