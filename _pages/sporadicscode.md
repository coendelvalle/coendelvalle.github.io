This page contains code necessary for the reproduction of computations executed as part my paper 'Greedy base sizes for sporadic simple groups'. In particular [my implementation of the greedy algorithm in MAGMA](/files/greedy.txt), and [my GAP implementation of the functions Qhat and D](/files/QD.txt)
